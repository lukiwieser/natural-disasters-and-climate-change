    "The population dataset by gapminder is a dataset containing information about the worlds population from 1800 until 2100.\n",
    "The data is a composition from different sources. There a two main sources - a dataset by Angus Maddison and the CLIO Infra Project -  and the World Population Prospects (WPP) provided by the UN.\n",
    "The dataset by Angus Maddison provides the data for the years 1800 - 1950. Population data after 1950 was taken from the WPP dataset.\n",
    "Additional sources were used, to fill missing values for years or regions. A details list of sources can be found in the documentation. (https://www.gapminder.org/data/documentation/gd003/)\n",
    "The primary data from the sources originates from census, informal census, indirect estimate and arbitrary guesses.\n",
